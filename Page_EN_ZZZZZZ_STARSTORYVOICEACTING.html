	  <!-- EN  ZZZZZZ_StarStoryVoiceActing -->
<h3>Hello boys and girls!</h3><p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/l3brs2o.png1~https://i.imgur.com/l3brs2o.png" alt="Wendicka with mike" style="float:right;border:0;" />
<p>From the very first version of Star Story, it was my desire to add voice acting, just like the Fairy Tale has, however, circumstances were not kind on me, so I could not do it. Now that the new (and hopefully final) version of the game is about to appear, perhaps I should try to get some voice actors.
<br /><br />
Since this is an amateur project without any kind of budget involved, I won't set high demands, but a minimum requirement is that you have mastered the pronuciation of the English language properly. Please read the role desciptions well, as a few roles may have a few more requirements.</p>
<p>Now the playable characters will likely have the most lines, not only scenario, but perhaps also some lines in battle. Characters with (B) behind their name will also appear in the game as a boss enemy. And here's the overview</p>
<ol type=i>
<li>Wendicka Lovejoy<ol type=a><li>Human female</li><li>Main protagonist</li><li>Tomboy</li><li>Rude, yet golden hearted</li><li>Very intelligent.</li><li>Wendicka does understand some alien languages, and this may come back in a few lines.</li></ol></li>
<li>Crystal McLeen<ol type=a><li>Human (cyborg) female</li><li>Deutagonist</li><li>Very calm in most situations, but when it really gets too much for her she can be a pain</li><li>I always pictured Crystal to have a slight Scottish accent, but it's definitely NOT a requirement</li><li>Naive</li></ol></li>
<li>Sean Briggs<ol type=1><li>Human Male</li><li>Commanding officer</li><li>Strict and business like</li><li>Easily annoyed</li><li>Only available during the game's prologue</li></ol></li>
<li>ExHuRU (B) <ol type=1><li>Android (appears male)</li><li>Only follows programming</li><li>One big requirement: ExHuRU has no emotion at all, so if you voice him, you will have to be able to speak monotone.</li></ol></li>
<li>Yirl, son of Astrolon<ol type=A><li>Klargin, Male</li><li>Smooth talker</li><li>Wendicka's love interest</li><li>IMPORTANT: Yirl  is fluent in both English and Dutch and although most of his lines are in English, he has a few Dutch lines, so proper pronunciation of the Dutch language is a requirement!</li></ol></li>
<li>Foxy Firefox<ol type=A><li>Vulpin Female</li><li>Thief and prostitute</li><li>Likes to talk on a suggestive tone even when sex is not the subject.</li><li>Although easily pissed off by Reggies smartass (and often sexist) remarks, she'll never yell at him, but be rather teasing.</li></ol></li>
<li>Xenobi<ol type=I><li>Human male</li><li>Ji knight</li><li>Can speak in a formal manner if needed, but is overall a kind person who can make you feel you can trust him.</li><li>Crystal's love interest</li><li>A very calm and understanding nature.</li></ol></li>
<li>Rolf van den Broek<ol type=I><li>Human male</li><li>Man of a few words.</li><li>His first language is Dutch, so proper pronunciation of that language is required. His English is downright terrible (his lines were for that reason constructed with Dutch grammar rules), and yes, if you can put up a horrible Dutch accent in the way you speak English, you may be perfect for Rolf.</li></ol></li>
<li>Admiral John Lovejoy<ol type=a><li>Human Male</li><li>Wendicka's father (by adoption)</li><li>Strict man, yet just</li></ol></li>
<li>Admiral Ashley Johnson<ol type=a><li>Human Female</li><li>78 old</li><li>Reputation as an "Iron Lady", yet she has a softer and even rebellious side</li></ol></li>
<li>Stork<ol type=1><li>Alien</li><li>Since sexuality on his kind is not comparable to humans the gender of the voice actor doesn't matter.</li><li>Only has a few lines, but is the kind of type that is in official business nobody should know about.</li></ol></li>
<li>Reggie Ryuda<ol type=1><li>Dragon (genatically manupulated). Gender unclear, but behavior implies male</li><li>Rude, constanly cracks bad (often sexually intimidating) jokes.</li><li>Yet highly intelligent</li></ol></li>
<li>Banika<ul><li>Vertian Female</li><li>Travelling merchant.</li></ul></li>
<li>Marquido<ul><li>Human Male</li><li>Ji Knight</li><li>Overenthousiast and therefore determined to kill if he thinks he has to</li></ul></li>
<li>Master Yayorn<ol type=A><li>Unknown species</li><li>Parody of Yoda and also talks as such</li></ol></li>
<li>The Mole (B)<ol type=A><li>Human Male</li><li>Of course, as this is a guy whose identity is secret, but will be revealed later, there are some spoilers on this one.</li><li>Normally speak business like and uncaring, but easily betrays his true self due to panic when confronted with something</li></ol></li>
<li>Klargin Pirate leader<ol type=I><li>Klargin Male</li><li>Evil and sadistic</li></ol></li>
<li>Sue McLeod<ol type=I><li>Human Female</li><li>Bilingual. Speaks Dutch and English fluently and has lines in both languages, so proper pronunciation of both languages is required.</li><li>Overexcited blabbermouth. People don't know whether to love her or hate her for that.</li><li>When good extreemly cheerful.</li><li>When mad extremely raging (and cursing)</li><li>Rolf's girl-friend</li></ol></li>
<li>Marlon McLeod<ol type=a><li>Human Male</li><li>Sue's father.</li><li>Calm and business like (actually hides his emotions)</li></ol></li>
<li>Doctor Sal'pr'drita<ol type=a>Octopedian</li><li>Although he prefers to be adressed with the male pronouns, his kind has no gender, as such both males and females can apply for this role.</li><li>Calm, patient and understanding.</li></ol></li>
<li>Kota<ol type=1><li>Vertian Male</li><li>Rude</li><li>Hateful</li></ol></li>
